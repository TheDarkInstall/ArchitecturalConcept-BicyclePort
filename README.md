# ArchitecturalConcept-BicyclePort
3D concept for a person wanting to build a bicycle port, outside their house.  This project led to the port being built for real.

Design started from a simple sketch on paper.  From there, a simple model was created in Blender3D, and modified through feedback to meet the structural and design requirements of the owner.

After the basic structure was worked out, the design was fine tuned, with a variety of different woods used to test how they would each look.

Extensive lighting and material programming was used on this model, to allow for effective visualisation of the bicycle port.  

Technical;

- HDR lighting
- Cycles rendering, and material creation
